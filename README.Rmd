# pgxr

The goal of `pgxr` is to provide tools to create a pipeline for pharmacogenomic
panel analysis in r. It currently is based off of published guidelines available
at [CPIC](https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/). Future work will include PharmGKB
information, as well as other guidelines.

## Installation

This is not currently released on CRAN, and is in development on github.
